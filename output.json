    "full_text": "In 100 days of code, you guys have done a great job. Everyone's tempo is very high. That's why today I'm going to tell you how we can get user input. If you interact with a program and it responds after that, then you will enjoy it a lot. Do you know why games are so addictive? Because whatever input they are giving to the computer, the computer responds to their input. And then they like this thing a lot. So we are giving input and the computer is responding. You can also give similar inputs to your Python programs. I will tell you how this thing is done. How Python program is inputted from your keyboard. Let's go to the computer screen and let's get started. The user input in Python programming is taken from the input function. The input function in Python programming takes a string prompt from you. It asks you what input you want to give. You can put a message in it. I'll show you exactly how this thing works. Let's zoom out a little. I've zoomed in a little too much. So I zoom out a little. I zoom out so much that it's visible and fun. So it's very simple. To take the user input, we use the input function. What is the input function? It's a very simple thing. What you have to do is, you have to do a variable is equal to input like this. In Python, we can take user input directly using input function. The input function gives a return value as string character. Hence, we have to pass that into the variable. Now I'll tell you what it means. It's very simple. If I write a is equal to input, and then print a, we've made this the most basic program to take the input in Python. So if I type Harry here, and press enter, it says Harry is printed. Or I could have done something like this. I could have said that my name is, and then I'll write a, so my name is Harry is printed. Because Harry is in A. So this was very simple. And you guys understood. I'll write Harry first. And then my name is Harry is printed. This was very simple. You understood. It's great. It's a good thing. Okay. But what can you do? You can also give a string in it. I can do something like this. Enter your name, and give a colon space. So here you'll enter your name. That is, the string that I've put in the input, it will show me literally. And if I write Harry here, then my name is Harry. It will show something like this. This means that the input function assigns the string that the user input. Like if you write A is equal to input, then the string that the user is going to write will come inside A. And your program waits for you if you have not given any string after input or after input. And if you have given a string, then that string shows. And then the program waits for you to input something from your keyboard. Okay. This is the input function. My name is A. You guys wrote it. So my name is Harry. So everyone is clear up to here. Now what happens is that a lot of people make a program. I mean, in Python programming, I'll say that this is the biggest doubt that people have. One of the biggest doubts that people come up with. Now I'll tell you what happens. People say that B is equal to input, enter first number. Okay. In fact, I'll make it X. Okay. I'll make it Y. And here I'll write input second number. Okay. So first number will come inside X. Second number will come inside Y. Now you print X plus Y. And I also got a comment. I don't know whose comment it was. But I got this comment. With this problem. Now I'll tell you what it was. Now look, if you print first number 10, and second number 3, suppose I print 100 first number. In fact, the one above is running. So I'll write Harry now. Now if you give first number, I gave 12. Second number, I gave 100. What should come? 112 should come. 100 and 12, 112 happens. But no. 12, 100 came. Now you'll say, okay, Python is bad. Python is bad. Many people say, my Python is bad. They bring doubts like this. No, first make your mistake. What's wrong with my Python? My computer is bad. They start talking like this when they have doubts in programming. Yes, things can be bad. But you understand. Now I'll tell you what's happening here. When we wrote X is equal to input, enter first number. So what happens is, whatever we input in X comes. Okay. But there is a rule. What is that rule? The rule is that whatever comes in X will come as a string. If you input a number, then Python's input function is not intelligent enough that it will detect your number. If you have put a number, then I should not take it as a string, but as a number. No. Python's input function says, whatever you enter, I'll take it as a string. Now, if you are entering a number, then type it in int. We had read typecasting. Convert it from one data type to another. So, X will be a string and Y will be a string. And when a string is added to Python, we haven't read string yet, but I'll tell you. When I'm doing X plus Y as a string, then Python literally adds the strings. It concatenates. That means if we add 12 and 100, if someone asks, what will happen if we add 12 and 100? If it's an integer, then 112 will come. Even a fourth-grade student knows this. And if a fourth-grade student is watching this, then comment. And if it's a string, 12 and 100, then what will happen? 12, 100. Something like this. That means these strings will be concatenated. If we add Harry, then if we add Lovish, then Harry, Lovish. It will be like this. If we add Rohan, then Harry, Rohan. It will be like this. As a string. Harry doesn't have a number. Rohan doesn't have a number. So, adding a new number will not work. So, by doing X plus Y, we get 12, 100. It's natural. What is it? It's natural. Now, you guys see here, if I want to take 112, then I'll print it like this. I'll say, look, X but as an integer. Y but as an integer. And add these two. Now, I'll run this program. First, I wrote Harry on the open name. I added 45 on the first number. And on the second number, I added 8. It will be 53. Okay. And this is what I printed X plus Y. It's 458. It's equal to 45. It's 8. Okay. So, this is concatenation. And this is actual arithmetic operation between two integers. So, arithmetic operation will happen when both integers are there. And here, both integers, you can see X and Y, both integers were not there. And here, we made them integers. Now, I'll tell you one more case. And I'll tell you its solution in this course, in 100 Days of Code. But I won't tell you its solution now. And I'll give you a hint. If you want to see, you can see. First, I gave 89. And I gave Harry the second number. Wait a minute. Harry is not a number. I just gave it. My wish. It happens that some people are made to break things. They break things. They spoil things. Anything is there. Anything came into their hands. They got a phone. They drop it in their hands. If it breaks, they blame the manufacturer. They didn't make it like this. I mean, it shouldn't break even if it falls. Okay. So, I'll hit enter. So, look here. It came in red color. This is error in Python. Python is saying that I did it. I did it. What Python did? I did it. Python said, I can't do it. I did it. Now you see. Python means, Python fell. Okay. Python is dead. Okay. Python said, I can't do it. Now you see. I did it. I can't do it. Okay. Now you see. So, here. Most recent call, file main.py line 8 in module. It's saying, I converted x into int. How can I convert harry into int? It means, Python is completely screwed. Okay. It fell in the ground. Okay. It happened like this. So, here, Python is saying that this is value error. It's not like it just falls. It also tells what happened. Why I screwed up. So, Python is saying this is value error. It's giving invalid literal. So, we gave integer. In integer, there is a string in int function which I could convert into integer. What harry caught me? So, this error came in Python. Okay. We can also display a text using input function. This will make input function. We have seen this. We can display text like this. And here, we could have converted it into float. So, whenever you are connecting two numbers or doing any arithmetic operation between them, what you should do is, convert them into integer, float or whatever number you want to convert them into. So, you should convert them into integer, float or whatever number you want to convert them into. So, we can take input like this in Python programming. And now, I want you to make an arithmetic operation to carry out. Remember what we did in exercise 1? Plus, minus, times, divide, exponent, I told you all the operators. I want you to put all those operators and see what happens if we take as a string that is if we are directly putting them in x and y then what is happening? And if we are doing this then what is happening? I want you to do this. And show me. Okay. So, this is the result. So, this is the result. So, this is the result. So, this is the result. So, So, in the"

    "full_text": "Welcome to 100 days of code guys In 100 days of code, we are going to learn Python programming from zero to job ready If you have given 100 days of your dedicated time I will tell you in a bite size lesson Python programming, we will take it to zero and take it to advanced In the beginning, you will feel how easy it is It is a child's play Python and after that As the videos will go ahead and we will go to day 100 We will raise the bar like anything We will be working on complex projects We will be working on things that are used in the industry So it will be a lot of fun and excitement Python is a dynamically typed object-oriented programming language Which was made by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 Guido Van Rossum was watching a show called Monty Python Circus When he was working on this language on TV And he thought why not give it a name And since then it has been called Python In this course, along with theory, we will do a lot of practice A lot of exercises and quizzes are going to come And a lot of challenges are waiting for you So that's why I will enter my computer button And I will introduce you to the strange and unique nature of Python So right now you like this video And subscribe and turn on the notifications So that you don't miss any day And every day you get notifications Because it is very easy to get lost in the sea of YouTube So you all have to accept the 100 days of code challenge right now Write in the comment section below I accept the 100 days of code challenge Let's get started So I have come to Google Chrome browser And I will tell you how to download and install Python So as soon as you write Python, you will come to python.org And here, according to your platform You will get the latest download of Python As you can see I am in Mac OS So for Mac OS, Python 3.11 is giving me So I will download it And as soon as it is downloaded, you can download your favorite IDE Or whatever you want to download To use Python in your computer But I will use the Wraplet And you can use Wraplet It is a collaborative browser-based IDE I am using it because I find it very easy to use And besides that, it will be very easy for me to give you code So here I will sign in from my Google account And after that I will be redirected to this screen So as you can see all my Wraplet are here Wraplet basically gives you an online way to write code If your computer is not fast or if you have a problem with it Compute wise, your computer lags a lot So you just need a browser tab And you can follow me And because I will use Wraplet It will be easy for you to follow me So here I will go to My Wraplet quickly I have already made some Wraplet And I will scroll down And go to the Python 0.2 job ready folder And here is our Day 1 Wraplet So as you can see here You can see my video in the floating pane And here will be our content And here we will write code So I will keep the console here And along with that I will show you the code I will close this I will write the code And here the output of the code will come So I will make a new file quickly So I will click here and open the main.py And I want to open the main.py here So you can see how easy it is to use it Here will be the tutorial Here we will write the code Here will be the output And here will be our video Which you can watch Here I have put a demo video You will get to see our day video If you are wondering how I did this I will give you a link in the description You will get to know how to do this In case a teacher is watching this So now let's talk about Python But before that I want to talk about What is programming So as you can see Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do And we do that with the help of programming If you have a calculator So the calculator has been programmed In such a way that we can tell it How much is 5 plus 9 Now you will say that 5 plus 9 is 14 I know this So why should I use calculator But how about 23453453 multiplied by 56456 You can calculate this But you can't do it as fast as a computer So in this case, a good communication With the computer is very important And for this we use programming The way I and you are talking in Hindi You must be talking to your friends in English You must be talking in Spanish Or you must be talking in any other language We use programming languages to talk to the computer Like Python, C, C++, Java And many more programming languages in the market But this course is going to be dedicated to Python And this is because Python is very easy Python is the easiest to learn programming language Because when you learn Python And then you start doing things Then you enjoy it at a different level Python is dynamically typed It is a general purpose programming language Which supports the object-oriented paradigm And also supports the functional approach Now if you don't know what these two are Then we will learn in this course Now it is interpreted It is a high-level programming language And we started working on it in 1989 Now many people ask When was Python developed? It was not a day or a year From 1989 to over the period of years When Gwido Han Rasm created it So you will see it in 1991 You will see it in 1992 You will see it in 1989 But the truth is that it was created Over the period of years starting from 1989 What are the features of Python? The first thing I will tell you is that It is simple It is the simplest programming language I think it is the best feature of Python And after that you can do anything with it It is platform-independent And it means that If you write code in Windows Then you can run it in Linux And if you write code in Mac Then you can run it in Windows You can run it in any platform I am writing code in my browser It doesn't matter if it is Mac Because I am using the raplet platform But if I write code in my Mac Then you can run it anywhere It becomes very easy To use Python It becomes very easy for you An open source programming language The biggest thing is that you don't have to pay To use Python which is amazing And Python provides very big library support So many people use this simple language Because of which Everyone Is working on some project And the project of all those people The code written by them The hard work written by them Maybe someone made something in a year And you can use it in a minute It is very good If I talk from the learning point of view Or error point of view Then I will say that The error you are getting today Maybe someone got it 10 years ago And they have broken it Or put it on a website like Stackoverflow It will become very easy for you It will become very easy for you To solve that problem Python provides a big library support After this It is very easy to integrate it With other programming languages Like C language It can be linked very well After this there are some applications Which I have written here You can work on database Data science, machine learning You can make web applications With database And to make your business Go ahead You can do many complex mathematical operations With the help of Python I am doing this because It is very easy to share the code It is very easy to install Python Even in local Why not on any platform You can install it Like any other game And If you are in Mac Installation is as simple as you see in your computer screen But if you are in Windows Then you can install Python And remember one thing If you are installing it in your computer Then you must check the option Which comes after passing Python 3.2 Because if you don't check it Then you may not be able to use Python from the terminal So if I open my terminal Whether you are in Windows Or wherever Then you can see here That Python is not found So we have to solve this problem If you are in Linux or Mac Then if you write Python You will get it So if you write Python 3 Then you will see Python's wrapper Wrapper is read-evaluate print loop And here you can use Python As a calculator You can use such commands If you don't know What is print statement We are going to read it But I want you to digest things Day by day So if you want to come out of the wrapper If you want to come out of this read-evaluate print loop Then you can exit And you will come out But you know what I am going to do I am going to use Rapplet And in Rapplet Whatever files and projects We make here Is called Rapplet And this name came from here Read-evaluate print loop Which is of Python Or it is derived from many programming languages So if I write hello world And click on run It is so easy to run I want to see its output And its output Why not Hello world Now if I do print 7 Or 5 and run it Then it will run And I will see 5 So basically what is happening I am writing code here But the code is executed on Rapplet And I am getting to see it here Even if my computer is slow Then I can run Python very well And I can make new files Or open new files And I can read this text Or watch this video Wherever I want to keep it Up, down, front, back Or if I don't want to watch this video I am practicing something So you can make it small And park it here And whenever you want to see You can make it bigger So it will be a very interesting experience So I will request you That everyone The playlist of Python Which I am going to make official Please do access it Like the video and subscribe the channel So that you don't miss any day I don't want you to miss any day In this journey of Python Please access the playlist Bookmark it and save it I will meet you in the next day We will talk about some good things And day 2 is going to be dedicated To some very interesting things So you guys wait for day 2 And we will meet after that That's it for this video Thank you for watching"

    "full_text": "Welcome back to 100 days of code Today I want to tell you a story of my personal life When I was in second year of college, I knew CC++ very well I was coding, I knew coding, I knew HTML But I was not able to work in any industry I was not able to get any CC++ project I am not saying that CC++ is a bad programming language I have made a lot of conditional related programs with the help of C++ I have done a lot of work, I have made a great calculator But I was not able to work in any industry When I was introduced to Python, I did web scraping I made GUIs, I made Plask applications I did a lot of freelancing And I consider Python as a language Which has actually told me the use of programming Why do we give so much value to programming in the industry And why is programming used so much in the industry In today's video, I am going to show you some programs Which will make you feel very happy You will also say that you have enjoyed watching these programs Because after watching those programs, you will understand the actual use What is programming, why programming is used I will tell you about 5 programs today And you will also enjoy watching those programs One of them is Jarvis Virtual Assistant Which runs on your map, it shows you the commands you say It shows you the commands you give The purpose of making this course of 100 days of code Is that Python has a lot of new things There are a lot of new approaches which I want to tell you And this brand new course will touch all of them For example, Valorous operator has come in Python There are a lot of other additions, there are easy ways to do things So we will cover all of these things in this course I will teach you Python in such a way that You can run Python on your map You can run Python on your map while programming You can do whatever you want, so let's go to the showcase And I will show you my programs which I made with the help of Python Let's get started So the first program I want to show you is Jarvis Virtual Assistant It takes your commands and after taking them It does some work As you can see, it has opened YouTube So it's a very cool program, you give it commands And it gives you the task After this, the next program I want to show you Is our Love Calculator It's an amazing calculator Which tells how much love there is in two people Now obviously, it will not tell accurately How much love there is in you and your partner So you all know it, but in a fun way We have used a random module to make this program If we put two names, it will tell the love percentage It will tell how much love there is in two people Let's try it out, I will put Harry in the name And I will add Pile in the partner name And calculate 97% Now let's say I write Let's say I write Sanskrit So I will write 03, 3% So I should be away from Sanskrit girls And not Harry It's a fun calculator I hope you will enjoy using it The next program I want to show you is face recognition Which uses the Harcascade algorithm It tells in an image where the face is It's a face detection algorithm So in Robert Downey Jr's face It will tell where the actual face is hidden So I will run it for 1.jpg file You can run it on your favorite file So I have run it And after running it, it detected all the faces So I can run it for different images It doesn't have to work for one image It works for different images It's a fun program The next project is Flappy Bird game Which probably someone has not played I have played it before We play it a lot on our phones But you can play it on your computer You can play Flappy Bird I can play it I am playing it It will be fun to play So the 5th, last but not the least I have made many projects I will show you how to make a snake game As you can see It's a black snake with red food I can make it better I made logic here I am playing it I will break the score of 90 I can make a lot of scores I am a hardcore gamer I have made a score of 90 I hope I don't get out I made a score of 100 It's fun to play a game made by your hands I just want to tell you In the upcoming videos, I will tell you about the things I am going to do And it's going to be fun Because we will not only make these projects But we will convert them into reality I am going to give you all these codes I want you to run all these codes in your system Whether you are able to run or not But run them All the modules I have imported You have to install them If not now, then when we go to modules You will have no problem in running them And if you have any problem, then we will gradually progress in this course You have to come back to this program And see what was the mistake I got a no module error So can I fix it or run it again It's not like you have to do everything in this video I hope you will enjoy these 500 programs I am giving you all these programs I have shown you all the programs They are available here You can run them on your machine And you will enjoy it Some of them are using windows API So they will run in windows like javas virtual assistant You can run it in mac or linux But we will do this only when we go further So I hope you will enjoy these programs And you will enjoy them But don't try to recreate them Don't think that you have learned so much And you want to change them You will get a little frustration Because you will try to do things that you don't know So we will make all these programs And show you all So keep this journey going And you will enjoy it You will get the link of this program in the description And one more thing I want to tell you If you haven't accessed the Python 100 days of Goat playlist Then you can access it now Because there will be a lot of videos in this playlist And if you don't bookmark this playlist Then you might miss some days So bookmark it And we will do a lot of fun things in the coming days Till then take care of yourself And I will see you next time"

    "full_text": "Welcome back to 100 days of code In today's video we will talk about modules and what is pip? Modules are used to borrow other's code that means you can use the code written by someone else in your Python program using modules Modules are two types We have built-in modules and we have external modules which are installed using pip External modules are the code written by people and they want you to use their code in your Python program Let's say I am using this phone and I don't know what is going on in this phone and how it is working This is an external module for me I don't know what its implementation is but I am able to use it Built-in modules are some modules which are shipped with Python programming language that means you don't need to install it externally We use modules because we don't want to code every basic thing with scratch If you are working in a big machine learning program and you are making some artificial intelligence let us say a self-driving car then you won't want to write an average of 10 numbers or write a program of geometric meaning of 10 numbers It can have a human error This code which is written inside modules is well tested and written by experts and because many people have used it there are very less chances of error Now if you want you can write the program with scratch for your understanding but if you use modules then you will save time and effort and you will be able to work on a big thing Let's go to the computer screen and we will install some modules and see how these things work Let's get started So guys I have come to my computer screen and I will open my day 3 raffle and you will get to see this video which I am recording now but because this video is not recorded I will keep it aside You will get to see the video and along with that I will adjust it like this you can adjust it according to your needs I want to tell you quickly what modules are in Python Whenever you write any code in Python programming language you can write it in two ways either you are writing the code yourself or you can take help from modules If you have installed Python in your computer and you go to your terminal and you write pip then you will get to see a utility because I am in Mac so pip3 will work in my computer if you are in Linux or Mac then pip3 will work pip works in Windows but you can see here as soon as I wrote pip3 I got to see many things here If I write pip3 install pandas now you don't need to know what is pandas and what I am writing so here it is written collecting pandas it is downloading a package from 1.1 MBps let me explain what is going on here when I write pip install pandas then I command my pip that I have to install a package called pandas now pandas is a data analysis library as you can see here but let me tell you that you can use many modules in the same way here I have used pandas now let me tell you a good analogy to explain these built-in and external modules when you were a kid your mom used to send you to get your stuff and she used to tell you to get milk, yogurt, bread, butter and whatever stuff you used to bring home was available at your home so you were basically a package manager whatever stuff you needed you used to bring it from a suitable place and keep it at home in the same way pip is a package manager whatever you need you can bring it from the internet and you can install it in python interpreter for example, it has installed pandas here as you can see now I can use pandas but do I need to bring everything? if you need a refrigerator then almost every house has a refrigerator and you don't need to bring the refrigerator from outside it is a built-in module it is available at your home every house has a needle, thread, spoon, plate so these are all built-in modules and you can get them in every house so you don't need to bring them from outside in the same way, built-in modules and external modules work so whatever modules we need to install we can do it from pip and if I write python3 here and if you are in windows, write python you will get to see python3.11 like this I will zoom it a little so if I write import pandas here you will not see the error but if I write import sklearn here then I will see the error I found there is no module named sklearn this is because this module was not in my computer now don't worry at all you won't understand what I am writing I know it I am just telling you for your understanding how modules are grabbed so I will come out of python's wrapper and write exit now if I want to install sklearn I will write pip3 install scikit-learn now when I use the package I will write sklearn but I will install it in the name of scikit-learn now it is being installed and it is being installed at a very good speed and if I write python3 here and write import sklearn then my work will be done now it is installing some dependencies which may take some time sklearn is a machine learning library what we are using now is not just yet so if I write sklearn here you will get to see machine learning library in python we will do everything don't worry now many people are commenting we know all these things I will meet them after a few days and when the difficulty level will increase and you will understand this follow me step by step now I want to show you as soon as it is installed and as soon as I write python3 I want to show you import sklearn that import sklearn will work here now see import sklearn it will work, no error so I will exit it now this thing which we can see by writing python3 is rapel repel means read, evaluate, print loop we will not use it we will write proper programs and we will execute it by writing python scripts and I am using raplet for this you can do it without raplet absolutely it is possible but I am using raplet because it is very convenient I will make a file and I will take the console output here you can see as soon as I drag it you will get to see my output and my video which will be super convenient for you so in main.py I will write import pandas and the best thing about raplet as soon as I run it it will detect that pandas is not there so it will automatically install it so don't be confused so raplet has started to install it for your convenience raplet wants you to be convenient while programming but you have to get concepts if you run it here you will get to see errors as I showed you but in raplet it has automatically installed pandas because raplet knows that if I import pandas I definitely want to use pandas so why not automatically install it which is a good thing so now I have installed pandas in python now I will write print high and now I will run it so it is installed as I can see pandas high so this is raplet's specialty now for your convenience I have written in text module is like a code library which is written by someone else and you can import it I will tell you more about it built-in modules and external modules which are shipped with python programming so let's write built-in modules in python and see which modules are built-in which I don't need to install see here all the modules are listed you can see here haslib let's import it and see when I import haslib will it be installed as I run it and see it is not installed simple high is written but on the other hand if I write import tensorflow I will show you tensorflow will be installed see here it has started because tensorflow is not a built-in module it is an external module which needs to be downloaded from internet so it is being imported so external modules need to be imported like your household items which are finished but you don't need to import the plate daily so it is a built-in module and the milk you import daily is an external module see here how to use pip command I have told you pip install pandas you can copy this code so whatever code I am writing you can copy it and paste it and you can run it so in pandas you can read csv like excel you can read it but don't get involved in this I am just telling you how this works I will show you in detail so don't worry many people are asking which python tutorial should I follow always follow latest videos in latest videos there is a lot of hype so if you are watching latest videos follow this if I use python version I will tell them to use latest version if you are watching on replete you don't need to worry about it and I will tell you as long as it is python 3 python 3.7, 3.11, 3.8 there won't be much difference your programs will work but if python 4 or python 5 comes then it can be a major upgrade it can be there is no guarantee that many things will be same in python 4 but don't worry about it which python you should use if I am watching python 3.11 then I can use 3.12 and see that absolutely yes you can see the basics will be same now the way we have this terminal in replete there is shell so if you write python in shell then the same thing will come python 3.8.12 is installed so if I write print hello ok I can't write hello in hello I will press enter hello is written so you get this terminal here and your ID is built in the browser so it becomes easy I will also come here and you will see the text tutorial written by me which will float in the window I have put a lot of effort so do not skip it so you will have a great learning experience which was our python first tutorial we have crossed almost 3 lakh views in 24 hours so this video was very trending so you must click here and bookmark click here and save this playlist you will enjoy it python is a very amazing programming language it uses youtube it uses instagram and facebook so who uses python who doesn't use python python is such a versatile language that almost all the big companies use python now it is clear to us why we are doing

    "full_text": "Guys, welcome to 100 days of code In today's video, we will write our first python program because this is going to be a python program in which we will understand each line we will have an understanding of what is happening in our python program and we are going to write it from scratch in the upcoming videos, we will write very dangerous python programs from scratch but this is going to be our first program let's go to the computer screen and let's get started Music So, I have come to my day 4's rapel and today we are going to write our first program we have already written our first program in fact, we have written many programs but this is going to be a program which I am going to write character by character, word by word from scratch so, it feels different so, what you guys should do first is write print now, what happens in print python programming? print is a function function is used to perform tasks print is a function to invoke any function we use this parenthesis like this as you can see, after writing p-r-i-n-t I have opened a parenthesis here and after that I can close it like this and whatever I write in this, I will get it printed suppose I write 7 here, I will get 7 printed but you know what we will do? we will write hello word and you must have heard about hello word in python programming in any programming language, when any code is written then the first program is written as hello word now, you guys see here as soon as I have written hello word, a red line has appeared what is this invalid syntax? let's run it and see what is this? from the initial error? yes, from the initial error we will learn only when we eat thokras so here you guys see, I have written print hello word I got an error do you know why this error came? when you use print in python then you have to give it a valid object hello word is not a valid object in python's eyes python says hello word is of no use to me yes, but if you enclose it in a double quote then python programming knows that you are talking about a string hello word is a string and let's run it and see and our first program is written hello word is visible to us here you guys see the output hello word is visible to us clap your hands and write congratulations in the comments for me, this is the first program which we have assembled character by character very good so far so good if I write here print and then I write 5 and then run it then first I will get hello word then I will get 5 we ran python in terminal we saw that when I write python3 in terminal like this and then I write print hello word then I get everything manually line by line I have to do everything manually one by one you see first I typed hello word then I typed print5 so will I type everything one by one? no, I don't need to type one by one I can make a script that's why I made this script which is main.py script means line by line execution of our code if I type hello word first then I will get that then print5 will execute and as I write print by like this and then I will run it then I will get hello word first then 5 and then by because the script is executing line by line now how is the print written? we don't have to go into its implementation if you want to know about the uses of print then you see this applet is showing as soon as I take my mouse here it will tell me to give values it will be object you can also give multiple values by typing comma like this like I typed hello word comma 7 then you see hello word and then 7 comes after a space then the next statement is executed then the next one is executed and line by line our script will be executed can we only print this script from python programming language? no, we can't only print we can do many things and this is the specialty of this course it will tell you what we will do but we are starting our first python program we are understanding things like what is script and when we execute a command here we give line by line to python interpreter anything in rapel, it is called rapel when we write python3 here python3 is called rapel this is read evaluate print loop I will give it 8 plus 9 so it will write 17 but after that I have to write something else I will get the output of the script as I write things, I will get the output ideally we don't want to do this ideally we want to process the sequence of instructions from python we want to tell python do this first execute this then execute this then do this and suppose I bought 10 rupees for a kilo of okra and I bought 5 kilos or suppose I bought 17 rupees for a kilo of okra and I bought 13 kilos so python will tell you you can do computations like this in print for multiplication you have to put star don't put x by mistake you have to put star for divide this one, plus and minus these are simple things so you can try this but here it is 221 rupees which I bought vegetables from so python will give you computations like this so you can try this so python will give you computations like this so python will give you computations like this so python will give you computations like this in coming videos we will learn more things you guys stay tuned I want to tell you that this course is not for anyone if you can't be consistent daily or if you want to do things in a short cut then this course is not for you because this course requires consistency it demands that you practice as you are watching the videos and give your time and come out with the day and complete the 100 days of code challenge you have to go till 100 days I will give you my attendance in the comment section I will see each comment if you want to learn in a short time and learn very fast without practicing then this course is not for you because it demands that you practice there is no elevator for success you have to take stairs and you have to climb these stairs with me for 800 days and trust me it will be worth it at the end I will tell you those things from my years of experience which took me a lot of time to learn and from the upcoming videos we will actually do coding we will write a lot of code over the next few videos and in fact over the next a lot of videos because we are going to do this challenge for 100 days that's it for now if you haven't accessed the playlist then do it bookmark it and save it that's it for now thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time BYE"

    "full_text": "Welcome to 100 days of code In today's video, we will see comments, escape sequence characters and print statement Whenever we do coding in Python programming language or any other language Sometimes we want to leave some text in that program which is not executed Whatever we write in our program, Python interpreter executes it But sometimes we want to write some lines in our program which are not executed For example, if I am writing a program So after 6 months, I might forget what is happening in that program So for me, it will be natural to write some lines in my program I want to add some lines which will tell future Harry about his program Or if I am working with my friend Shivam or with my friend Rohan So I have to tell them what I am doing in the program How my program is working I will use this in this program So let's see the escape sequence characters and print statement of comments Let's go to the computer screen and let's get started So what I will do here is I will open my main.py file here So I am going to files and I will open main.py here as always And here you can see my main.py output So if I write here print hey I am a good boy So there is no doubt that I am a good boy So here it will be printed In fact, in the print statement, double quotes, whatever you will give You will get to see it here So here I got to see the print statement And here you can see that if I write here hey I am a good boy So suppose I type enter here And this viewer is also a good boy So if I run this here So what is this red line I am getting to see This is a sign of danger What kind of error is this UL while scanning string literal So let me tell you what it means Python is basically saying that you know what You wrote the print here and started the double quotes But I didn't like the enter here I didn't like it So you will say what should I do I want a new line after the boy Python says to you that you need a new line So you use escape sequence characters Or you have to put backslash n like this And you don't have to hit this new line literally Just write backslash n Python will take care of it So you will say backslash n is fine I am a good boy You will run the code like this And this viewer is also a good boy And you got a new line So what was this backslash n This was an escape sequence character I will talk about this today And I will tell you what are escape sequence characters And what are the other escape sequence characters But before that I would like to tell you what are the comments Suppose I am working on a code base I am working on code with ary.com And we are working on that website Both of us are working on it Suppose I want to tell you That there is a new design on code with ary.com's homepage And I will bring it after 2 days Suppose I am going to comment That don't change this design Don't remove this line I want to write Hey Harry please don't remove this line Suppose I want to say Don't remove this line I am working on it I want to keep this line in code base But you can see Python Devtan is angry Nagraj is saying What is going on Where did this invalid syntax come from I think it is print I think there are many other syntax But he says hey Harry please don't remove this line I didn't like it Python says this I don't have any doubt And you must be knowing what is this But I still want to keep this line Please, I am telling Python Python says ok, don't cry like kids I will tell you how to keep this Python says I have a comment Comment means you can keep any text I don't care about that You will say wow Python you are so good Python says yes I am so good What should I do Python says you put a character like this And this will be a comment What will this be This will be a comment And after this if you mark any line First of all, it is replying Syntax highlighting You can write syntax highlighting in any id In this case, this comment is showing in green color And here, syntax highlighting is working Print is in yellow color String literal is in orange color Then these brackets are also visible in different color Error is visible in red color So this is syntax highlighting Which is a wrap or any id which is given to you Hey Harry, please don't remove this line Let's run it And our program is running I can write some text in my program I can put some information Like suppose I want to mark that this program's author is Harry And suppose I want to mark that this course is 100 days of code Okay Suppose I want to write this So I can write Now I will tell you a secret Okay, what is that secret I told you You can select multiple lines And control or command If you are in Mac, control plus forward slash As you press this You can comment or uncomment any code base So whenever I see you commenting many lines like this I have done that with control plus forward slash Okay So control plus forward slash You can use this Okay Any one line Yes Oh no, Siri, what happened Siri, no, I am not talking to you So here I was telling you that You can mark these multiple lines As comments Or you can uncomment them Okay, that's great So here I have written A comment is a part of coding file that the programmer does not want to execute Rather the programmer uses it to either explain a block of code or to avoid the execution of a specific part of code while testing This means Suppose I write a comment Suppose I write code Suppose I want to write this Print hello word Suppose I show my boss I tell him that I wrote this program How does it look like Boss says that it's great I don't like this Let's remove hello word I will select and do control forward slash And now I can remove this code Now suppose My boss asks my boss Why did you remove hello word It looked great So I can do this And hello word will come again So this is how hello word can be Comment or uncomment So this is what I have written You don't need to write code Copy and paste And run As you will do This is a single line comment You won't see the error You will see the print statement I have given another example You can write a comment after a line Suppose you wrote something like this I am pasting it And I will do something like this I have written print And what can I do I removed this I should have put this back Now as soon as I write print And then hello word And then I can write any comment So my code Will be executed And as soon as it gets pound symbol It will say ok I understood I don't want to execute So I will ignore it And it will ignore the printing hello word What would have happened if this didn't happen Obviously there will be an error You know it too Syntax error It will say what is going on Print hello word was ok But it will say What did you put printing hello word I didn't like it So you can see As soon as I put Pound symbol And then run It will say ok you can see Now see here What can I do I can comment out the code I have already told you But I want to tell you one more thing How to write multi line comments Now I will tell you the story of multi line comments Suppose someone told me Let's take this example Suppose someone told me To uncomment these three lines I have two ways Now because I am living in modern world I have IDEs, I have replete I have modern IDEs So I will select and control forward slash This shortcut is provided by Replete, VS code By modern IDEs Which helps you to comment Or uncomment But if I can't do this Then I use triple single code For my convenience And whatever I write in it I am pressing alt and down arrow To move the line All the shortcuts of VS code Are working in replete So you won't face any problem And if you want to learn the shortcuts of VS code You can search on google I have a video of VS code But we will focus on python So if I enclose anything in triple single code Then it will be multi line comment What was written before Was not multi line comment It was also a kind of multi line comment So I wrote that You can use pound symbol Or you can use pound symbol But you can also use triple single code Or triple double code I will tell you this Triple single code program is working But triple double code program is also working I have put triple double code And I will press shift and Control X, Control V And will run it And it will work after that Okay, you are watching It worked It is very good Now here We can comment and uncomment Anything If I have written any line I will select them and I will press control or command plus forward slash So I can use To comment on the shortcut Okay, I hope you understood this Let's talk about Escape sequence characters If you want to insert Characters in a string For example, here it is written Hey, I am a good boy And after that If I want to insert a new line character How will I do that? I will comment this So that you can see Only the output of this print statement You understood why I did this So that you can focus on this print statement Hey, I am a good boy and this Viewer is also a good Boy slash girl Now see here What I have written in this tutorial To insert characters that cannot Directly be used in a string We use escape sequence characters One thing is that A character that cannot be used directly in a string Like we use escape sequence characters For example If I have entered a new line character It will be an error Because python won't be able to parse this If you have entered a new line in a string Literally it won't be able to parse That's why we enter new line character Backslash plus n But this is one character This is called escape sequence character Backslash plus n is a new line character It is an escape sequence character Which you can see in a string Like this So if I run this Hey, I am a good boy This will be in a new line What about I want to Enclose this in double code Like this This should work, right? If you think like this See, the applet has given a signal It has started ringing Tantantantantan So IDE is ringing It says that you don't have to run this And if you have done it You will see an error You will say that what is the problem Do you know the problem When you started the print statement And started your string with double code Then there is confusion That is this string is starting Is it ending here You know that it is not ending here It is ending here But our Python interpreter gets confused He says that you have started double code here And here you have started double code again It means it is ending here Ok, it is ending here Then what is this? This is invalid syntax for Python Because if it is making a string from here to here Then what is this good boy So you will see an error To avoid this We don't use double code character We use double code escape sequence So this is one character This is another character Now I will run this So here I will see only double code Hey I am a good boy Double code is coming Did you see backslash here? No But I used backslash Why? Because I wanted to use backslash double code Which is one character It looks like two characters But this is one character So we use single double code What happens is an escape sequence character An escape sequence character Is a backslash followed by The character you want to insert An example of a character that cannot be directly used As string If the string in your print Is in single code It is made like this Then you cannot use single code Do you understand? Now we will read these things in the strings chapter But if I put it in single code I cannot put single code I have to put backslash single code See the error is there If I put backslash single code Then it will come in single code After Hey I am, a single code is added So I can put single code in strings like this So this was our escape sequence character I hope you understood Now I want to tell you About print statement First of all What I want to tell you is You can give multiple values Like I can give here Hey, 6 and 7 I can give these three values And if I run it then I will get to see all three Hey, 6 and 7 As you can see here in your computer screen Now after this There is another parameter That is separator If I put this character And now I run it Then you will get to see When I put this It will get separated from tilde character As you can see here After Hey, there is tilde And after this there is another tilde So if you want to join These three things with a given separator You can do it like I did So you can do this After this there is another parameter End is equal to Suppose here instead of end is equal to I write double zero nine What does it mean? It means if I write a print statement And in it Suppose I write print Harry And I run it So you can see here Hey, 6 and 7 After that the next print statement Will be 009 Ideally we write End is equal to 009 backslash n We can also write End is equal to null By default it is backslash n We can also write end is equal to null You should also know this Now here if I write 009 backslash n So whenever I run the next print statement 009 backslash n will be printed In my print statement What is the difference between end and step? Step means the multiple values That you have given in one print statement What will they be separated from? The default separator is Space, as I have written here The default separator is space Then what does end mean? Specify what to print at the end When this print statement ends Then what to print By default it is a new line If you want to override this Behavior If you go from one print to another Then there should be no new line Like I ran this print statement Then a new line is automatically printed Then a new line is automatically printed If I don't put end is equal to this But because I have put end is equal to 009 Backslash n So here it will be printed After this print statement And the separator is What is the difference between the multiple values? Now there is one more argument File and you have to keep this in mind I have written this Because I want you to know That you can write print statements on file as well Default is sys.stdout It will write on stdout Wherever you are running it It will show you on console We will talk about this fourth argument later I will come to this in detail in the coming videos As we progress in this course Here I have written Parameters 2 and 4 are optional Parameters 2 and 4 are optional Means you don't need to Write separator, end and all these things You don't need to write file Without this your print statement works Like we saw where we put separator Neither we put end Neither we put multiple values You can also put single values But it will work even if you give multiple values I hope you are enjoying If you haven't yet access this code Then do it Everyone do bookmark Because all the videos will be added in the playlist Click on it Click here and bookmark this playlist Click here and save That's it for this video Thank you so much for watching this video And I will see you Next time Thank you"

    "full_text": "Oh wow! You have reached day 6 of 100 days of code That's what I wanted to tell you Today I will tell you what variables are Variables are like containers Like you have containers in your kitchen where you have lentils, flour, rice Variables are like that This analogy fits on variables in Python programming language If I have a container and in this container is lentils and after that I put rice in this container So I basically changed the content of this container On the other hand, if I bring another container and I put water in this container and after that I put milk in this container So I can change the content of this container In Python, you keep making containers and you keep storing data in it This data is stored in memory It is stored in RAM What is the data type? Like if there is a container it can contain liquids, solids, lentils, sugar It can be something that is not edible Like we have a lot of things like a cleaning liquid It is not edible So there are different types of everything In this way, there are different types in Python There are different data types Let's go to the computer screen and see what are the data types and how they work Let's get started So what exactly is a variable? Let's understand this first A variable is like a container as I have already told you But what kind of a container is this? It is stored in memory If you find all these things confusing then you can come here to main.py and see what I am doing here and you will know how to make a variable in Python and why it is important to make a variable in Python If I write a is equal to 1 then I need to do this much and I have done print a So basically I am saying that in memory, in RAM in my computer's RAM store 1 that is, store 1 in the actual memory and give that address to a where the store is Now this will sound a bit complex But by writing a is equal to 1 whenever I use a that is, whenever I want to refer the value inside it I will print it Now you might think that I remember a is equal to 1 I shouldn't do print1 directly Why should I run this program? How about this? If I do this then you have made a program to save a number A is equal to 1 and it is being printed So by writing a is equal to 1 this number is stored in a and by printing a it is printed Can I do something like this? b is equal to Harry The answer is yes I can do this But if I run it I will get only this number printed and if I print it too then you will see that I will get this Harry printed too which is great because this is a different data type and this is a different data type Now you will say that when you wrote 1, 2, 3, 4, 4 in Harry you didn't write double quotes But why didn't you write Harry like this? You didn't write like this because you will get an error Now why will you get an error? You will say that I could have written Harry directly But we have to write double quotes because we represent a string data type so that if you have ever done this maybe someone said this that Harry is equal to 9 Now someone says b is equal to Harry Now how will he know if you want to print Harry string or you want to print 9 If I run this program then I will get 9 printed You can see here 9 is printed So it is possible that you want to print Harry literally but you want to print 9 That's why there are some rules in Python I will erase this now If I write b is equal to double quotes Harry then everything that is printed in double quotes will be printed as you can see here Now I will tell you what I have written for you So what is variable? Variable is like a container that holds data A container that holds data Very similar to how our containers in kitchen hold sugar Like in your kitchen, salt, sugar, salt and all are used to hold boxes Creating a variable is just like creating a placeholder in memory assigning it some value And here I have shown you 4 types of variables I have declared them to you Now these are 4 different types of variables Meaning that they are different For example, suppose you are a animal A dog is also a animal An ant is also a animal But we are all different animals Similarly, a is equal to 1 is a different type of variable b is equal to 2 is a different type of variable c is equal to Harry is a different type of variable d is equal to Harry is a different type of variable You are watching this video on 1x Now if I write a is equal to 1 then an integer is stored in a b is equal to true then a boolean is stored in b c is equal to Harry is a string and d is equal to none type So here we have a variable of none type So there are 4 different types of data types What is data type? Why do we need data type? I have told you that we need data type so that we can store different values in our memory Data type specifies the type of value which a variable can hold This is required in programming to perform operations For example, if I write print a plus b Will this add Harry to it? You can see an error here It says that one is your integer and the other is your string How will you add it? Even if I make this number smaller How will you add Harry to 123? What do you want? You have gone to your plan Python is saying that we want to concatenate So Python will say What do you want to concatenate? You are adding a plus How will I know that you don't want to concatenate? So what we do here is When we do a plus b we can do two similar data types So I will do one thing I will make a variable a1 and write 9 If I write a plus a1 then this operation will work and you can see here it will write 132 This was very simple You must know that we need data types so that we can perform various operations without causing an error In Python we can print the type of operator using type function Suppose a variable is made and I want to know its type So I can know it like this I can say the type of a is and I can write a comma here type of a So I have closed its bracket type of a and I have closed its bracket of this opening parenthesis So if I run this then type of a is class int so a is an integer Let's see if we can do this with b or not I will run and type of b is class str and same thing type of c is and see here what type of c will be I will see a1 Let's do one thing Let's make c Let's make all the variables directly So all the trees are done Now if I run this type of c will write a1 is not defined what happened print a plus a1 I will define a1 because I have to give this program to you your understanding is important So here you see type of a is int, type of b is bool type of c is string So these are the three types printed So it's very good Now let me tell you some built-in data types in python First built-in data type is number which I have told you int float complex If a is equal to I will do 1.1 you saw type of a was integer So if I do 1.1 this type of a will float and if I write this I write 8 plus 2i so this is a complex number Actually to make this complex number I have to do something like this I will do 8,2 and as I do this it will become a complex number and you see here 8 plus 2j is a complex number If you don't know about complex numbers that's totally fine I don't expect you to know complex numbers but I just wanted to tell you that you can make complex numbers in python These are real part and imaginary part numbers If you have read complex numbers in class 12 good for you If you haven't read complex numbers in class 11 but there are different boards so in some class 12, in some 11 Anyways, class complex is shown here I just wanted to show you that it has become a complex number So here you can see that it can be integer type floating point type complex type and string type Hello world double code Python programming these are all strings then if I talk about boolean data then these can be true or false Now why we want to use this Suppose you write a function and you want to return that you can drive or not If you don't know what functions are there then I will tell you suppose I want to tell you that you can drive or not then you can give me only one small information yes or no These booleans work in the same way You don't need to say directly that I can drive you don't need to give so much information You can say yes or no yes means true or false Like string has a lot of information h, r, r, y and many more But if you want to know if you can drive or not you can say yes or no and you should be good So these are all boolean data types ok What we use when we will use we will see all these in the coming time Then there is a sequence data I will talk about list and tuple and we don't have to go into complex I just want to tell you that List is an ordered collection of data types and we will read it in the future So I won't tell you here If you want to know about list be patient I will tell you about list So what is list List is basically collection of different data elements which can be of different data types like integer, float, list list of items which can be of different data types I will tell you this much and we can change this list what is tuple exactly the same thing I am telling you in simple language except that they are immutable Immutable means they can't be changed ok Now people confuse mutable and immutable like many people tell me from my experience many people tell me that they can't remember mutable or immutable so we have a problem I will tell you how to remember Let's say you have read mutation mutation means changes like in a theory a human had a tail and then mutations and from that mutation human tail disappeared I am not teaching you biology but mutation means change if you have read genetic algorithm or if you have read biology in class 10 or class 9 mutation means changes like first monkey then human so mutable means change immutable means change not changed this is a way to remember you might remember I remember I was telling you people who don't remember now see here I made a list list is collection of items tuple is also same except the fact that you can't change it if you change it tuple will give error now how to change it we will keep it for tuple video then another type of data is map data what is this? dictionary is in your house? no? you must know what is dictionary it is collection of key value pairs you want to see the meaning of abandon abandon is a key it has a value you want to see the meaning of food food is a key food is known now one more thing you want to see mutable mutable will have a value this is what mutable means I wrote in dictionary key value pairs I can store anything as key value pairs I can store as key value pairs how many marks are there child's name how many marks are there all this information can be stored which I wanted to tell you now you come here and see here name, age, age 20 can vote true it is printed like this name, age 20 can vote true I will tell you more about dictionary in upcoming videos now you understand that dictionary is map data you can map one thing with another name, marks can you vote or not is she a good girl or not how is she in studies how many marks she gets how is her behavior discipline discipline or not you understand right these are all things and it will become a dictionary I hope you understood now I want to say one thing which may blow your mind your mind may blow maybe not but you will think in python everything is an object everything dictionary is an object if you make a dictionary then it is an object if you make a bullion then it is an object integer is an object that's why you see here when we printed it you see here type of A is class complex class pool why class is written now you will say what is class class object I will tell you everything in upcoming videos when we will reach object oriented programming for now remember this everything is an object in python remember this and if you remember this then I will remind you but for now forget this, it doesn't mean anything I didn't tell you this but when we will make a video about classes and objects I will explain this in the video where I said everything is an object for now grasp the concept of data types there are different types of data you can read them ok that's it for this video I hope you enjoyed it if you haven't accessed python playlist yet then click here and bookmark it and save it that's it for this video thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time"

Do it if you have the guts Let's go to the computer screen and I will tell you what question you have to solve Music So guys, first of all I would like to tell you about operators And why operators are important And after that I will give you an exercise So operators are a simple thing The mathematics we have studied Even if you are in class 5 Then you should know what an operator is If you are watching this video in 4th class then listen to what happens Addition is 15 plus 7 Combine the two numbers You took a toffee for 15 rupees You took a toffee for 7 rupees How much did the shopkeeper pay? 21 rupees No wrong answer 22 rupees Okay, you are not paying attention Listen carefully 15 plus 7 is 22 Similarly, 15 minus 7 is 9 Wrong answer is 8 So you guys should be careful Even if I say 9, you guys should be shocked How did this person say 15 minus 7 is 9? So 15 minus 7 is What are you teaching? It's 8 But I am just trying to tell you that All operators are in Python You know multiplication If I write print 5 plus 6 here You guys will say what kind of circus is going on here I'll close this for a while You will say what kind of circus is going on here 5 plus 6 is 11 We know that But what if I tell you That you guys I'll make it 15 So that I can also do minus You guys also do the same Okay And I start and then divide So all these results will be printed on the screen 6, 5 is 11 15 minus 6 is 9 And then 15 multiplied by 6 is how much? You don't remember the table, it's 90 Then after that, 15 divided by 6 is 2.5 Okay So you guys know this thing well What should I tell you? But a new operator Which may be new for some people That is floor division operator If I want to take 2.5 out of 2.5 Then I will use floor division operator Okay One more operator is modulo operator And what does modulo operator do? It does simple work Modulo operator If I write 15% 6 Then it means That If I divide 15 by 6 Or I give you a very simple example I do 5% 3 If I divide by 3, then 2 will be remainder Simple thing So this gives remainder If I If I divide 5 by 3, then 2 will be remainder So 2 is giving remainder 15 Double divided by 6 15 divided by 6 is 2.5 But after dividing by 2 0.5 will be finished And only 2 will be left 15 divided by 6 is 2.5 15 multiplied by 6 is 90 So these are all operators Which is addition, subtraction, multiplication Now exponential operator Which I have shown wrongly This is division actually So I will correct it This is division operator And I will tell you what is exponential operator Print 5 I will do star star 3 Okay, I will print it So this is 5 to the power 3 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5 I will fix it and come back How did I write divide in exponential? Now some of you will say I made a mistake while making apple You have made a mistake It happens every time It happens every time Now see star star I have written exponential here And I have told you all these operators Try out yourself 5 star star 3 means 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5 3 times If I do 5 star star 4 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5 multiplied by 5 If we multiply 5 4 times What will happen to each other? Okay, it's a simple thing 2 multiplied by 2 Double star 4 if I do So 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 2 multiplied by 2 Okay, 4 times 2 How much will it be? 16 It's a simple thing Try it out 16 will come Now I will tell you all here The exercise I have given you Before that I want to run a simple thing here This program you have to run If you don't solve the exercise But I will not run it Okay, I will not tell you the explanation of it This is just for you You have to see it When you are not able to solve the exercise And I know everyone can solve the exercise It's a very simple exercise And you will go to the next page of this apple Here you will see the exercise Which is create a calculator What you have to do is Make a calculator Which is capable of performing addition Subtraction multiplication and division operations on two numbers He could do all these operations on two numbers Make two numbers as variables Okay And I will not give much hint It's very simple And you have to show the output It's very simple I will give more hints in this too So man because I already know Comments are going to come What is the point of giving such a simple exercise The point is that many people are starting out from programming So give them confidence And they have the curiosity of programming in them Okay I hope you will enjoy it Now I would like to tell you one more thing In the next video Right next video I am announcing this too That this is our video number 7 Day 6 Sorry day 7 We will solve this question on day 8 And I will shout out to those people Those people who solve it I will tell you what to do You will not say that you didn't tell me What you have to do is Go to the cover page of this rappel You will see this rappel like this Okay What you have to do here is You have to make your own rappel Okay You made your own rappel It will be a very simple rappel In which this calculator will be made Make sure that it is run by pressing the run button Select python and make your own rappel And after that You can comment on the link of that rappel This is the comment section of this rappel In the comment section of day 7 Your rappel should be there And you tell me in the comment section And tell me in the comment section of rappel 8 Okay Because what will happen with that I will open rappel directly from here And Assembly I will be able to access your rappel And I will shout out to those people Who solve this quickly But don't do it wrong because of the hurry If you start out now Take time and do it Competition is not with anyone It's just about I just want you to do it You do it is very important You do it first is not important at all Believe me Not at all You will understand things with time Not at all Competition Do it yourself Okay Don't defeat anyone You have to win yourself You have to move forward yourself Okay With this I end this video If you have not accessed the playlist yet Then click on the playlist And book it And save it You are watching this video in 1x Thank you so much guys for watching this video And I will see you Next time"

    "full_text": "I am feeling good after seeing your enthusiasm in 100 days of code and in today's video, I will give shoutout to all of you who have solved our exercise 1 and then I will tell you the solution let's go on the computer screen and let's get started Music So I have come inside my computer screen and as you can see I am going to open its solution's wrapper which I have made So I have come to my wrapper 0 to hero day 8 we will see the solution in this but along with the solution we are going to see what all people have done in day 7 and in day 7 where is my day 7's wrapper I will open it and I am going to give shoutout to all of you so whoever posted their comment and most importantly they posted the solution so I will click on the cover page and see all these people oh my god they are posting so fast we need this tempo we will be in a rush in 100 days of code 20 seconds ago 23 seconds ago I want us to be in a rush in this 100 days of code series that we will be in a rush so here you can see what we talked about that we need to make a calculator yes I know I have told you some things like what is data type we talked about all these things but this exercise was very simple and I got comments and I had said in the video that I will get comments that why are you making it so easy some people are starting programming give me 5 to 6 days time and see where I will take the level and I will ensure that everyone understands whatever I am teaching here so here we need to add addition, subtraction, multiplication and division I didn't say modulo I didn't say flow division you can add if you want but here I am simply saying a is equal to 56 and b is equal to 7 or 3 and see what I am going to do here I will make it easy so that I can verify my calculation the value of and I will write 50 so I will write 50 in a comma or I will write a and then I will write plus then I will write value b 3 is and then I will write plus basically I am adding it I will add a comma by doing this the value of which is a string then this is a string then this is a number then I will add a comma then another string will be printed I will print a plus b here and as you can see as I run it the output will come so I can do this which I have done here a plus b I can do the same with other operations now I don't need to add space automatically a space comes when we print a comma this print and this print come together now I simply need to replicate this plus down arrow is the shortcut of the VSCode line gets replicated not line alt plus shift plus down arrow I am not doing any magic and whatever magic I am doing you can do it too not only in this series but in your life whatever I am doing you can do it too and if someone is doing it you can do it too if someone says you can't do it then he is lying to you you can do it so this is the value of a plus b now you can see 50 plus 3 now I don't know what to do I am pressing alt shift and clicking on it ok I am clicking on it something like this I will click on alt and I will get multiple cursor and I can edit in all of them you can see how amazing this is this is also a shortcut of VSCode now you can see all the shortcuts of VSCode are available in the raplet I am using the raplet so that things get easy here you can see the value of 50 plus 3 50 minus 3 50 multiplied by 3 and 50 divided by 3 and that's about it this is the solution to our first exercise now I will come to exercise no.1 we need a reload let me see who is giving the solution 4 seconds ago Taha Pasha has given the solution Ashitosh Zalte has given the solution 4 seconds ago I hope I pronounced your name right if I pronounce someone's name wrong then please forgive me otherwise I will get comments like oh love you, love you too bro now I am going to load more comments I know I won't be able to reach the bottom but it would be unfair if I don't so I am loading more comments what is going on I have opened someone's profile so I am going to take my time and take my time oops, I will scroll all the way down give me some time so I have scrolled I took some time now look here I am going to open some rapels I wasn't able to find the link I uploaded this on day6 I wasn't able to find the link I think I can find the link click on it now here calculator give shoutout to all of them with full tempo by the way in case you are in a hurry and want to move to the next topic you can leave this video because shoutout is going on so I will give shoutout to Kunal Panchal try to as soon as you click on run your rapel will run now I can see files here but your rapel is not running well you did it really quick yes you did it really quick Kunal Panchal let me see your code so here you have your 6, then 9 now don't use all of this you have used the files disqualified man just kidding I am kidding it doesn't matter but it is disqualified if you are using something did I say this in the first video yes your argument is that you didn't say this so it's not disqualified but in future if I never said this then you have to use what we have done till day 7 just use knowledge use AFLs, match case use artificial intelligence use anything everyone knows but you have to use your rapel actually I had to choose a number from above so I choose 43 and gave invalid input you handled the error too I will write 4, 5, 1 and 9 very good now next shoutout to Suryansh Kumar Suryansh Kumar made this rapel and got 3 comments Suryansh Kumar big thumbs up to you are you disqualified? I gave wrong operation let's see how they behave now I don't have to do error handling so no tension first number is 4 second number is 65 oops I am making mistakes every time so your user interface should not be confusing user will make mistake and blame you remember this plus and 3 great big shoutout to Suryansh Kumar next shoutout to Kirtan, Tushar Gameplex Sobin Banerjee Omesh Goyal Nirmith Mishra 21Beit 30010OM big shoutout what is your name? tell me in comments OMG Piyuj Goyal what did you show you made this rapel amazing Piyuj Goyal first number is 4 second number is 1 amazing big shoutout to Piyuj Goyal for attempting this rapel day 7 I am running running I am checking the code you have written the code but why did you use input why did you use input you could have used hardcode but no problem you should have used input great big shoutout to Kandy Insta next shoutout to Priyanka Gar in upcoming videos we will see more things and the upcoming exercises will not be easy so my friends wait be patient patience is the fruit of strawberry flavor so be patient and in upcoming videos we will increase the level and if you are watching day 70 and day 80 then you will see a different level I hope you are enjoying this course I will see you in day 9 day 7 you will get the rapels keep practicing and keep coming daily in 100 days of code and we will make a lot of noise that's it for this video thank you so much for watching this video and I will see you next time bye"

    "full_text": "What a great thing friends, even in day 9, consistency of 100 days of code is consistent. Today I will tell you about typecasting. This term sounds scary to hear, but I will tell you that it is very simple. We made a string variable and it has 27 written in it. We closed it in double quotes because it was a string. But if we add it in 3, then it will not come to 30. Because it is a 27 string and 3 is an integer. So if we want to tell python that the thing written in double quotes is a valid number, then we can typecast it to an integer by using int function. How all these things work, we will see in detail in this video. Let's go to the computer screen and let's get started. Music Let's see about typecasting today. What is typecasting? Why is it important? I got a comment, let me tell you what it was. The comment was that I did A plus B, A was 1, B was 2 and I got 12. I got a smile on my face. I thought that these are the problems. Harry used to have these problems in the past and he used to think like that. Today he will tell you why these problems have come. Now let's see what happens. Suppose you wrote A is equal to 1. I am telling you a genuine problem that comes to python developers. And developers get frustrated. Now you said that you will print A plus B. Now you will say that why are you teaching kids things. Why are you teaching kids things like 1 plus 2 is 3. Why are you wasting time in this course. Now what did you think? That 13 will come, sorry 3 will come, 12 is coming. Now let me tell you why 12 came. A is a string, B is a string. Python doesn't know that the content in your string is a number. When Python gets two strings, it keeps them equal to one. If you had written Harry and brother here. Where Harry and brother would have written here. Let me show you. If you had written Harry and brother here, wouldn't it have been a number detection. Harry would have stuck them side by side. Because this is how string concatenation happens. So if you write 1 and 2, it will also stick side by side. So what is the solution? This 1 is a string, this 2 is a string. Convert this into an integer. Now I'll duplicate both lines by pressing alt, shift and down arrow. I wrote A is equal to 1 and B is equal to 2. I don't need to comment on these lines. Because the value of A was a string and I made it a 1 as a number. But I'll comment on it for clarity. Control plus forward slash is a shortcut. People keep asking what shortcut is it. Control plus forward slash. If I use this shortcut in the future, remember this. Let me come back to A1 and B2. Let's run. 3 is here. Because this time it was A and B. I was getting a lot of complaints. I can't see it. Now I can see it. It's quite big. So what is typecasting? I wrote it here. The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as typecasting in Python. Or it's also called type conversion. Python supports a lot of functions. Not about data types. It's about functions. int, str, ord, hex, oct, tuple, set, list, dict. These are all methods. Not about data types. These are all data types. This is a function that helps in converting any other data type into these data types. Now it'll try to convert. Now you'll ask me to convert Harry into integer. How? How? How? Harry is written. It's a name. How to convert it into integer? If you have a 1 in your string, then you'll understand. One string is there. Don't make one as a string. Make one as a number. I understand that. But what is this? Make Harry a number. It gets angry. It gets angry. It says, what? You want to convert Harry into a number? You can't. There are two types of typecasting. But before that, I'll tell you the basic typecasting. Suppose I don't want to make A as a number. I want to convert it into this. My A will be a string, my B will be a string. I'll say it. Suppose something like this happens. I'll use an int function. Add int of A and int of B. It doesn't come 12. It converts into integer first. Then it converts B into integer. It converts A into integer. B into integer. It becomes 1 and 2 as a number. It's like this. If I don't do int A and int B, then 1 and 2 comes. But what will happen if I make it 1 Harry? This time, there will be an error. Python will say, I can convert 1 into a number. I can convert it into a valid integer entry. How do I convert 1 Harry? So, Python gives an error. So, your strings should be valid. If you're converting into any data type. Whichever data type you're converting into, if you're converting into an integer, it should be a valid integer. If you're converting into a float, it should be a valid float. It should be valid. Python can do its work. It's not like you're giving Python a problem. There are two types of casting. Explicit and Implicit. Explicit means I'm doing it. Implicit means Python is doing it automatically. I'll tell you about both. Explicit conversion means I'm doing it as a programmer. I'm telling Python interpreter to convert this data type into this data type. Like I did in this case. I told Python to convert the string into integer. I told Python to do this. I'll do it. What did Python say? I'll do it. It did it in integer. When we combined both, we got 2 and 1. Did it come or not? Absolutely. So, what is explicit conversion? We're doing it separately. What is implicit conversion? Python is doing it. I've understood explicit conversion. I'm a big reader. Explicit type conversion. It'll be a waste of time. It can be with the help of Python built-in function. Conversion function, inflow, hex, oct, string, etc. You're watching in 1x. Don't worry about the video. I've given an example. You have to run it by yourself. This is your job. Do this exercise. The sum of both the numbers is 22. This is the output. Now, I'll talk about implicit typecasting. Implicit typecasting means you convert your data type. We'll do it. You won't. I'll tell you what happens. Data types in Python do not have the same level. Ordering of data types is not the same in Python. Some of the data types have higher order and some have lower order. Whenever we perform operations in 2 variables, a small type, which is a lower order variable, is converted to a higher order. I'll write a comment here. I'll write implicit typecasting. Suppose I write c is equal to 1.9 and I write d is equal to 8. If I write print c plus d here, what will happen? c plus d will be converted into an integer. So, I'll get the result in float. I'll get the result in float. I got 9.9. My data type is float. As I've written here, according to the level, one data type is converted to another automatically by Python interpreter. This is called implicit type conversion. Python converts a smaller data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss. If it converted c into an integer, it would've been 9. But it didn't. It converted d into float. c plus d got 9.9. So, this is implicit typecasting. I've given an example in Python. It's a very similar example. What was its type? It was an integer. It was a float. The result will be float. You can use type function to find out. I hope you enjoyed this video. If you don't want to access Python playlist, do it now. Go and bookmark this playlist. Save it as well.
